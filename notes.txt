at init, class should prepare cache or kernels as appropriate
we should try to reuse a single class instance at the POPPY level
maybe offer a high level helper as a function at the module level
centering should not be specified at init time, since it can just be a cache key part

need a profiling script to check performance characteristics of different implementations and caching strategies
perhaps make a sequence of standard array shapes:
    100x100 -- five times with different input arrays
    100x200
    200x100

wait, what's the scaling factor here? there's input pix and output pix
